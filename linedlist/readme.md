BIG Pros:
• A Linked List can grow dynamically.
(To resize an array you have to create a new, larger array, and copy everything over)
• A linked list does NOT need contiguous memory.
(A Java 1-D array has to occupy contiguous memory. When storing large amounts of data,
finding back-to-back-to-back… memory can be impossible)
