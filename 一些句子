len(nums)-2 is because we need at least 3 numbers to continue.
if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1] is because when i = 0, 
it doesn't need to check if it's a duplicate element since it doesn't even have a previous element to compare with. And nums[i] == nums[i-1] is to prevent checking duplicate again. (This seems to be a good pattern which has been seen in other questions as well).
